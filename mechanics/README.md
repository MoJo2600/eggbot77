This directory contains the files for 3d printing in stl format.

Most of the files have been gathered from the interwebz:

[Vladislav Trigubovich](https://www.thingiverse.com/trigubovich/) has created the [base design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2422393/). The following files have been copied from that (licensed under CC BY-4.0):
- Box_Intersecting_Rods.stl
- Pen_Stepper_Holder_Foot.stl
- Pen_Stepper_Holder-V2.stl
- Tailstock_Holder.stl
- Rotational_Stepper_Holder_Foot.stl
- Rotational_Stepper_Holder.stl
- Faucet.stl

[schuetzi99](https://www.thingiverse.com/schuetzi99) has provided a remix which replaces the bought metal spring with a printed one and fitting toolmount and penarm (licensed under CC BY-NC-SA-4.0):
- toolmount.stl ([OpenSCAD](OpenSCAD/toolmount.scad))
- spring-3mm.stl (modified by me to allow for a 3mm screw, [OpenSCAD](OpenSCAD/spring-3mm.scad))
- penarm-stronger.stl (modified by me to strengthen the arms holding the servo, [OpenSCAD](OpenSCAD/penarm-stronger.scad))
He also provided his files in OpenSCAD format which made modifications dead simple :)

I have designed two new files for holding the egg (print in TPU) replacing the original PLA ones using suction cups:
- tpu-eierhalter-lagerseite.stl
- tpu-eierhalter-stiftseite.stl

Optionally you can also print the pads for the feet (print 2 each in TPU):
- tpu-pad-15x13.stl
- tpu-pad-16x15.stl
- tpu-pad-19x15.stl
