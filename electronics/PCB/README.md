Notes when ordering at jlcpcb. From above help page:

  "Just to be safe, you can write a special instruction in the remark area in our
  ordering system when you place the order, write like:
  "Please note: there are 3 plated slotted holes in this design".
  Our CAM engineer will sort them out from the "context"
  (like the annular ring and solder mask opening) when processing the files."
